  abstract = {Internet of Things Operating Systems (IoT OSs) run, manage and control IoT devices. Therefore, it is important to secure the source code for IoT OSs, especially if they are deployed on devices used for human care and safety. In this paper, we report the results of our investigations of the security status and the presence of security vulnerabilities in the source code of the most popular open source IoT OSs. Through this research, three Static Analysis Tools (Cppcheck, Flawfinder and RATS) were used to examine the code of sixteen different releases of four different C/C++ IoT OSs, with 48 examinations, regarding the presence of vulnerabilities from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). The examination reveals that IoT OS code still suffers from errors that lead to security vulnerabilities and increase the opportunity of security breaches. The total number of errors in IoT OSs is increasing from version to the next, while error density, i.e., errors per 1K of physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC) is decreasing chronologically for all IoT Oss, with few exceptions. The most prevalent vulnerabilities in IoT OS source code were CWE-561, CWE-398 and CWE-563 according to Cppcheck, (CWE-119!/CWE-120), CWE-120 and CWE-126 according to Flawfinder, and CWE-119, CWE-120 and CWE-134 according to RATS. Additionally, the CodeScene tool was used to investigate the development of the evolutionary properties of IoT OSs and the relationship between them and the presence of IoT OS vulnerabilities. CodeScene reveals strong positive correlation between the total number of security errors within IoT OSs and SLOC, as well as strong negative correlation between the total number of security errors and Code Health. CodeScene also indicates strong positive correlation between security error density (errors per 1K SLOC) and the presence of hotspots (frequency of code changes and code complexity), as well as strong negative correlation between security error density and the Qualitative Team Experience, which is a measure of the experience of the IoT OS developers.},

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of IoT devices has brought about numerous security challenges due to their relatively simple internal architecture and low-powered hardware warranted by their small footprint requirement. As there are billions of IoT devices in use today, the sheer number of such devices pose a great security challenge as they are often constrained by a number of hardware and software limitations in addition to being designed with a focus on convenience, ease of use, mass production, and low cost, rather than security. The seemingly exponentially increasing number of such devices make it harder to keep track of -- and patch -- insecure IoT devices. This paper explores the common security threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities relating to IoT devices and highlights the challenges associated with securing them against emerging security threats and cyberattacks. Due to their role as gateways to connected devices and susceptibility to forming botnets or facilitating man-in-the-middle attacks, IoT devices are a lucrative target for cybercriminals. The paper discusses various remediation and mitigation techniques that can be implemented to better secure IoT devices, including access control mechanisms, secure communication protocols, and regular updates and patches. By better understanding the security challenges associated with IoT devices and implementing effective mitigation techniques, individuals and businesses can ensure the safety, security, and privacy of their connected devices and networks.},

Hence, we perform an in-depth security evaluation of the state-of-the-art Intellectual Property Encapsulation (IPE) technology found in widely used off-the-shelf, Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontrollers. While we find IPE to be promising, bearing remarkable similarities with trusted execution environments (TEEs) from research and industry, we reveal several fundamental protection shortcomings in current IPE hardware. We show that many software-level attack techniques from the academic TEE literature apply to this platform, and we discover a novel attack primitive, dubbed controlled call corruption, exploiting a vulnerability in the IPE access control mechanism. Our practical, end-to-end attack scenarios demonstrate a complete bypass of confidentiality and integrity guarantees of IPE-protected programs.},

The IoT is pervasive and is almost an integral part of our daily life. These connected devices often obtain user's personal data and store it online. The security of collected data is a big concern in recent times. As devices are becoming increasingly connected, privacy and security issues become more and more critical and these need to be addressed on an urgent basis. IoT implementations and devices are eminently prone to threats that could compromise the security and privacy of the consumers, which, in turn, could influence its practical deployment. In recent past, some research has been carried out to secure IoT devices with an intention to alleviate the security concerns of users. There have been research on blockchain technologies to tackle the privacy and security issues of the collected data in IoT. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the security and privacy issues in IoT systems. To this effect, the paper examines the security issues at each layer in the IoT protocol stack, identifies the under-lying challenges and key security requirements and provides a brief overview of existing security solutions to safeguard the IoT from the layered context.},

As security IT countermeasures are gradually been installed in many embedded system nodes, thus securing them from many well-know cyber attacks there is a lurking danger that is still overlooked. Apart from the software vulnerabilities that typical malicious programs use, there are some very interesting hardware vulnerabilities that can be exploited in order to mount devastating software or hardware attacks (typically undetected by software countermeasures) capable of fully compromising any embedded system device. Real-time microarchitecture attacks such as the cache side-channel attacks are such case but also the newly discovered Rowhammer fault injection attack that can be mounted even remotely to gain full access to a device DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory). Under the light of the above dangers that are focused on the device hardware structure, in this paper, an overview of this attack field is provided including attacks, threat directives and countermeasures. The goal of this paper is not to exhaustively overview attacks and countermeasures but rather to survey the various, possible, existing attack directions and highlight the security risks that they can pose to security critical embedded systems as well as indicate their strength on compromising the Quality of Service (QoS) such systems are designed to provide.},

Apart from denial of service, privacy, and safety concerns, compromised devices can be used as enablers for committing a variety of crime and e-crime. Despite ongoing research and study, there remains a significant gap in the thorough analysis of security challenges, feasible solutions, and open secure problems for IoT. To bridge this gap, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in IoT security with a critical investigation-based approach. This includes a detailed analysis of vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems and potential attacks. We present a holistic review of the security properties required to be adopted by IoT devices, applications, and services to mitigate IoT vulnerabilities and, thus, successful attacks. Moreover, we identify challenges to the design of security protocols for IoT systems in which constituent devices vary markedly in capability (such as storage, computation speed, hardware architecture, and communication interfaces). Next, we review existing research and feasible solutions for IoT security. We highlight a set of open problems not yet addressed among existing security solutions. We provide a set of new perspectives for future research on such issues including secure service discovery, on-device credential security, and network anomaly detection. We also provide directions for designing a forensic investigation framework for IoT infrastructures to inspect relevant criminal cases, execute a cyber forensic process, and determine the facts about a given incident. This framework offers a means to better capture information on successful attacks as part of a feedback mechanism to thwart future vulnerabilities and threats. This systematic holistic review will both inform on current challenges in IoT security and ideally motivate their future resolution.},

The inherent complexity presented by the vast IoT ecosystem ends up in an insufficient understanding of individual system components and their interactions, leading to numerous security challenges. In order to create a secure IoT platform from the ground up, there is a need for a unifying operating system (OS) that can act as a cornerstone regulating the development of stable and secure solutions. In this paper, we present a classification of the security challenges stemming from the manifold aspects of IoT development. We also specify security requirements to direct the secure development of an unifying IoT OS to resolve many of those ensuing challenges. Survey of several modern IoT OSs confirm that while the developers of the OSs have taken many alternative approaches to implement security, we are far from engineering an adequately secure and unified architecture. More broadly, the study presented in this paper can help address the growing need for a secure and unified platform to base IoT development on and assure the safe, secure, and reliable operation of IoT in critical domains.},

To raise awareness among potential stakeholders interested in this technology, this paper provides an extensive analysis and categorization of existing vulnerabilities in TEEs and highlights the design flaws that led to them. The presented vulnerabilities, which are not only extracted from existing literature but also from publicly available exploits and databases, are accompanied by some effective countermeasures to reduce the likelihood of new attacks.

  abstract = {The popularity of IoT has raised grave security and privacy concerns. There is a misconception that security and privacy issues of IoT systems are caused by the hardware and its cost. In this paper, we will explore the use of microcontrollers (MCUs) and crypto modules in IoT applications and demonstrate that hardware and cost may not be the bottleneck of IoT security and privacy in various application domains. We discuss how to implement hardware security, system/firmware security, network security, and data security with the low-cost Espressif's ESP32, TI's CC3220 and Microchip's cryptographic co-processor ATECC608A. We perform extensive experiments to validate the performance of cryptographic and networking operations of IoT devices based on those and other MCUs and crypto modules. We are the first to perform a comprehensive measurement and comparison of cryptographic and networking performance of these modern IoT MCUs and modules.},

  abstract = {Often overlooked, microcontrollers are the central component in embedded systems which drive the evolution toward the Internet of Things (IoT). They are small, easy to handle, low cost, and with myriads of pervasive applications. An increasing number of microcontroller-equipped systems are security and safety critical. In this tutorial, we take a critical look at the security aspects of today's microcontrollers. We demonstrate why the implementation of sensitive applications on a standard microcontroller can lead to severe security problems. To this end, we summarize various threats to microcontroller-based systems, including side-channel analysis and different methods for extracting embedded code. In two case studies, we demonstrate the relevance of these techniques in real-world applications: Both analyzed systems, a widely used digital locking system and the YubiKey 2 onetime password generator, turned out to be susceptible to attacks against the actual implementations, allowing an adversary to extract the cryptographic keys which, in turn, leads to a total collapse of the system security.},

  abstract = {Arm Cortex-M processors are the most widely used 32-bit microcontrollers among embedded and Internet-of-Things devices. Despite the widespread usage, there has been little effort in summarizing their hardware security features, characterizing the limitations and vulnerabilities of their hardware and software stack, and systematizing the research on securing these systems. The goals and contributions of this paper are multi-fold. First, we analyze the hardware security limitations and issues of Cortex-M systems. Second, we conducted a deep study of the software stack designed for Cortex-M and revealed its limitations, which is accompanied by an empirical analysis of 1,797 real-world firmware. Third, we categorize the reported bugs in Cortex-M software systems. Finally, we systematize the efforts that aim at securing Cortex-M systems and evaluate them in terms of the protections they offer, runtime performance, required hardware features, etc. Based on the insights, we develop a set of recommendations for the research community and MCU software developers.},

  abstract = {Abstract             IoT and Embedded devices grow at an exponential rate, however, without adequate security mechanisms in place. One of the key challenges in the cyber world is the security of these devices. One of the main reasons that these devices are active targets for large-scale cyber-attacks is a lack of security standards and thorough testing by manufacturers. Manufacturer-specific operating systems or firmware of various architectures and characteristics are typically included with these devices. However, due to a lack of security testing and/or late patching, the underlying firmware or operating systems are vulnerable to numerous types of vulnerabilities. Reverse engineering and in-depth research of the firmware is required to detect the vulnerabilities. In this paper, we've delved into various aspects of IoT and embedded devices. This includes a comprehensive survey on the architecture of firmware, techniques for firmware extraction, and state-of-the-art vulnerability analysis frameworks for the detection of vulnerabilities using various approaches like static, dynamic, and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, we've scrutinized the challenges of existing vulnerability analysis frameworks and proposed a novel framework to address these issues.},
